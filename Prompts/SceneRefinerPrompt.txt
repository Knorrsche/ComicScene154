You are given narrative data from a comic. Your task is to construct a hierarchical scene breakdown based on this data.

### Hierarchy Structure:
1. **Major Arcs** (Broad thematic or structural divisions)
2. **Sub-Scenes** (Clusters of related narrative arcs contributing to a specific event or sequence)
3. **Narrative Arcs** (Individual moments within a sub-scene, following narrative grammar)

### Instructions:
- **Identify Narrative Arcs**:
  - A narrative arc should capture a complete small event (e.g., a conversation, action sequence, or transition).
  - Each arc should include:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Starting panel & page
    - Occurring characters
    - Coordinates of starting panel
    - Breakdown using narrative grammar (Establisher, Initial, Peak, Release)

- **Group Narrative Arcs into Sub-Scenes**:
  - A sub-scene consists of multiple related narrative arcs that together form a meaningful event or section.
  - Provide a title, summary, and justification for grouping these arcs together.

- **Form Major Arcs from Sub-Scenes**:
  - A major arc is a broader thematic structure formed by multiple sub-scenes.
  - It should have a title, description, and key themes tying the sub-scenes together.

### Scene Structuring & Panel Placement:
Each scene must specify its starting page and panel number
A scene does not have to start at the first panel of a page (e.g., it can begin at Page 3, Panel 4 if narratively justified).
Consider narrative connections across pages rather than forcing boundaries based on page breaks.

### Use of Narrative Grammar (Cohn):
- **Establisher**: Introduces setting and context
- **Initial**: Initiates an action or event
- **Peak**: The climax or high point of the event
- **Release**: The resolution or transition out of the arc

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

### Final Notes:
Each major arc should feel like a cohesive overarching event, while sub-scenes focus on smaller narrative sequences within it.
The arcs have to be continous - so start with arc 1 page 1 panel 1 until end, do not mix the order.
Narrative arcs should be small, self-contained interactions but connected by sub-scenes and major arcs.
Avoid strict page-based divisionsâ€”let narrative flow dictate structure.
Only output the arc_id, title, starting_page and panel_index_of_start for the narrative arcs in the output.
Ensure that the output is valid json.
